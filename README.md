# Thermal Field

This project focus on explore the new theory / computational scheme based on thermal field theory

The project has two parts:

I. MR-CC project: 
Applying thermal-field theory on multi-reference coupled cluster theory for dynamical correlation electronic structure problems. 

II. Thermal properties project:
Applying thermal-field theory for statistical mechanics for finite temperature or time dependent electronic structure problems.

This method refers to the paper:
Nooijen, Marcel, and Songhao Bao. "Normal ordered exponential approach to thermal properties and time-correlation functions: general theory and simple examples." Molecular Physics 119.21-22 (2021): e1980832.
